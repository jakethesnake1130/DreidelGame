# DreidelGame
This takes the player through the Dreidel game. If you're unfamiliar, you can find the rules here: https://www.bellalunatoys.com/pages/dreidel-rules
DreidelGame.java is the driver class, and handles most of the proper "game" (albeit not in the main method) 
while Player.java manages all of the variables for each of the two players using getter and setter methods.
